OWASP Top 10 - 2021:

1. Broken Access Control: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.
2. Cryptographic Failures: Sensitive data is not properly protected in transit or at rest.
3. Injection: Untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
4. Insecure Design: Weaknesses due to missing or ineffective security controls in software design.
5. Security Misconfiguration: Insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations.
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Using components with known vulnerabilities.
7. Identification and Authentication Failures: Weaknesses in authentication and session management.
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures: Code and infrastructure not protected from integrity violations.
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Insufficient logging, detection, and alerting.
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.

Secure programming practices include:
- Validating and sanitizing all inputs.
- Using HTTPS and strong encryption.
- Limiting user permissions and access.
- Keeping dependencies and libraries updated.
- Avoiding hardcoded secrets and credentials.
- Writing unit tests for security-related code paths.
